24. Explain the concept of bit manipulation and its advantages in algorithm design.

Ans: 
	Bit manipulation refers to using bitwise operators to directly interact with individual bits of data (typically integers). These operations involve logic at the binary (0/1) level and include:
- 

& (AND)

- 
| (OR)

- 
^ (XOR)

- 
~ (NOT)

- 
<< (left shift)

- 
>> (right shift)



Each bitwise operation is extremely fast and often runs in constant time, making them very useful in algorithm design.



Advantages in Algorithm Design:

1. Efficiency
2. Compactness
3. Low-level control
4. Memory optimization
