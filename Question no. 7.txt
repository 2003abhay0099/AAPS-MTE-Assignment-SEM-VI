7. Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems.


Ans:-

The Sliding Window Technique is a two-pointer approach commonly used to reduce the time complexity of algorithms dealing with contiguous data — like arrays or strings.


Instead of checking every possible substring (which can be very slow), the idea is to:

1. 

Use a "window" (a range in the array/string) that can expand and contract.


2. Move the window efficiently through the structure while maintaining a condition (like unique characters, fixed length, sum, etc.).



How It Works
:

1.Start with two pointers (left and right) at the beginning.


2.Expand right to include new elements.



3. If the window violates the condition, shrink it from the left.


4. 
Update your result whenever the window meets your condition.



Use in String Problems
:

Sliding Window is especially helpful when dealing with:

1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Use a HashSet to track unique chars.
- 

Expand right, shrink left if there's a repeat.

2. Find All Anagrams of a Pattern in a Text
- Fixed-size window = pattern length.


- Use frequency counts to compare sliding window with pattern.

3. Minimum Window Substring

- Find the smallest substring in s that contains all characters of t.
- 

Use character frequencies and expand/contract the window accordingly.


Benefits:

1. Efficient
2. Easy to implement
