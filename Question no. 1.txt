1. Explain the concept of a prefix sum array and its applications.

Ans:-

A prefix sum array is an auxiliary array used to store the cumulative sum of elements of the original array. It helps in answering range sum queries efficiently.



Let’s say we have an array arr[] of size n, the prefix sum array prefixSum[] is built as:



prefixSum[0] = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + arr[i];
}

Example:


Given: arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 6]


Then the prefix sum array becomes:

prefixSum = [2, 6, 7, 10, 16]



To find the sum of elements from index 1 to 3:


sum = prefixSum[3] - prefixSum[0] = 10 - 2 = 8



Applications:


a. Range sum queries

b. 
Subarray sum detection

c. 

Optimization in DP
