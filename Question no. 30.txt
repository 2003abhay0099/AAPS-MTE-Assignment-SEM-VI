30. Explain the concept of linked lists and their applications in algorithm design.

Ans:

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:


     - Data


     - A reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence


Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory. This dynamic structure allows efficient insertion and deletion.




Types of Linked Lists
:

1. Singly Linked List – Each node points to the next node.


2. Doubly Linked List – Each node points to both previous and next nodes.


3. Circular Linked List – Last node connects back to the head.




Applications in Algorithm Design
:

1. Dynamic Data Management: Useful when the size of the data structure changes frequently.



2. Stacks & Queues: Can be implemented using singly/doubly linked lists.

3. 

Hash Tables: Handle collisions via separate chaining (linked lists at each index).



4. Graphs: Adjacency lists use linked lists for storing neighbors.

5. 

Memory Management: Free lists (for dynamic memory allocation) are built using linked lists.
