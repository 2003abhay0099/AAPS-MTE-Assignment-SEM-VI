50. Explain the concept of equilibrium index and its applications in array problems.


Ans:

An equilibrium index in an array is an index i where the sum of all the elements to the left of i is equal to the sum of all the elements to the right of i. In other words, if you have an array arr[], then the equilibrium index i satisfies the following condition:
	- 
sum(arr[0] to arr[i-1]) = sum(arr[i+1] to arr[n-1])


Where:

        - 
arr[0] to arr[i-1] are the elements before the index i.


        - arr[i+1] to arr[n-1] are the elements after the index i.



If no such index exists, the result is no equilibrium index.




Applications of Equilibrium Index:

1. Load Balancing.
2. Partition Problems.
3. Optimization Problems.
4. Dynamic Programming.
