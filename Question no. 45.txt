45. Explain the concept of priority queues and their applications in algorithm design.

Ans:

A Priority Queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority.
Elements are served based on their priority, not on the order they arrived (unlike a normal queue).


        - Higher priority elements are dequeued before lower priority elements.

        - 
If two elements have the same priority, they are dequeued based on the order they were inserted.


Applications of Priority Queues in Algorithm Design:

1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
2. Huffman Encoding
3. Scheduling Problems
4. Load Balancing:
