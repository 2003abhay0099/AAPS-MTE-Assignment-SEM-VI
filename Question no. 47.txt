47. Explain the concept of histogram problems and their applications in algorithm design.

Ans:

A Histogram problem usually involves a bar chart (histogram) where each bar has a certain height, and all bars are of equal width.


The most famous histogram problem is:

        - 
Largest Rectangle in a Histogram:


        - Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed inside the histogram, using consecutive bars.


The heights of the bars are given as an array.

You have to choose bars together (consecutive) and find the rectangle with the maximum area.




Applications of Histogram Problems in Algorithm Design:

1. Finding Maximum Area Rectangle in 2D Matrix.
2. Rain Water Trapping Problem.
3. Pattern Recognition.
4. Stock Span Problems.
